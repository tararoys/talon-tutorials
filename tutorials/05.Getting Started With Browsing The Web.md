# Getting Started With Browsing The Web

The commands in this help menu are designed to work across a variety of browsers.'

# Get Access To The Browser Commands

In order to see all the commands I can use with a browser, I say:  help context generic browser

In order to launch a browser like Firefox, I say:  launch firefox

Opening a new Firefox window will immediately put me in the address bar.'
If I am not in the address bar already, I can get to the address bar by saying "go address."


If I say this command into the address bar:
air trap air red air plex yank dot smash consulting

This spells out my webpage, ataraxy.consulting

to visit the webpage, press the enter key by saying the command
enter
Scrolling A Webpage

Now that I am on a webpage, one of the first things I want to be able to do is scroll.'


My favorite method of scrolling is with keyboard shortcuts.'
Specifically, I like to use the page down and page up keys.'
These keys scroll the webpage one page down and one page up.'
I can press these keys with the Talon voice command: 'page down'
Try pressing the keys with the voice command: 'page up'

The knausj repository does have some other scroll commands.'wheel down' 'wheel up'

Wheel down is just like 'page down,' but it uses a different command.'   It is meant to represent the mousewheel.'
try 'wheel tiny down' 'wheel tiny up' 

Wheel tiny down and wheel tiny up scroll only a little bit  This is what most people prefer- they do not prefer to scroll one page at a time, and instead like to scroll a little bit at a time.'


In order to look up the mouse scrolling commands in the help menu, it is possible to say:
help context mouse

The scrolling commands will probably be on the second page of the mouse help menu, and you can explore and find the commands that you prefer the most.'
 To get to the next page of the help menu, I use the command
help next
Using Tab Navigation On A Webpage

To navigate around the page with keyboard commands, the simplest default way is to use the tab key.'
 The tab key will put the keyboard focus on the next clickable element.'
 Usually this means that the keyboard focus will be on the next link on the page, but it could be the next text field or the next checkbox.'
 If it is a link, the link will generally have an outline of some sort showing that it is ready to be selected.'
 When that happens, pressing 'enter' will do the same thing as clicking the link.'
tab
shift tab

There are several, much faster ways to navigate around page, but they all involve installing extra things that do not come with knausj-talon by default.'
 As a result, using the ordinals to tab your way through a page is fairly fast.'
  For example,
tab fifth

This will tab through the next five focusable elements.'

Discovering More Commands

There are several more browser commands, which can be found in the help menu using the command : help context generic browser

#Using Tabs Effectively

I already talked about tabs, but tabs and tab management are very important to successful browsing.'


There are also a lot of tab commands, which can be found in the help menu using the command:help context tabs

To open a new tab, I say 'tab new'

To go to the next tab, I say 'tab next'

To go to the last tab, I say 'tab last'

And to close the tab I am on, I say 'tab close' 

Using Windows Effectively

There are also a lot of windowing commands, which can be found in the help menu using the command 'help context window management'

To open a new window, I say 'window new'

The window next and window last commands do NOT work on the Windows operating system because windows does not have a built-in keyboard shortcut to make that a simple thing to do.'

The windows snap position commands are very interesting.'
 In the help menu , the command says
snap <user.window_snap_position> 

I'm not going to explain what that means, except to say that the help documentation is missing examples of what the words for 'snap position' are.'

So here's some examples.'

To put the window on left-hand side, I say 'snap left'

To put the window on the right-hand half of the screen, I say 'snap right'

To put the window on the top of the screen, I say 'snap top'

To put the window on the bottom of the screen, I say 'snap bottom'
