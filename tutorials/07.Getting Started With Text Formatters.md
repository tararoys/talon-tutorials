# Getting Started With Formatters

The knausj-talon_master repository as a very powerful set of prebuilt text formatters that allows me to easily write things like book titles, file names, a websites, hashtags, and all sorts of other phrases that are not formatted as standard prose.

Let's say I wanted to write out the title of a book.
I good use the following command:
title introduction to talon: a hands free user guide

 the result would be: An Introduction to Talon:A Hands Free User Guide

To see a help menu of all the available formatters, I can say
help format

Unlike all the other help menus, in order to close this one I have to say 'help format' again.
 This is a usability bug that has been open for awhile.
