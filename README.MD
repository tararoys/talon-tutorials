# Welcome to Talon Introductory Tutorials!

Using the Tutorial. 

This is a set of tutorials designed to get the most basic talon beginner up and running their computer with Talon voice control and the Knausj Talon script set.  

To install this, drag the folder containing all of the files anywhere into the Talon user directory.  You can open the Talon user directory by clicking on the Talon icon, clicking on scripting, and clicking on ```open ~/Talon.```  

Say 'Tutorial Menu.'  A list Talon tutorials will pop up.  

Say the name of the tutorial to open that tutorial. Clicking on the tutorial will also open the tutorial. 

Saying 'tutorial close' will close the tutorial. 

Saying 'tutorial open' will reopen where you were in the tutorial. 

Saying 'tutorial menu' and selecting another tutorial will open a new tutorial in the same window. However, the old tutorial will be bookmarked at the spot you were at, so when you open it again it will automatically open at the spot you left off.  


# Writing tutorials 

You can write tutorials by writing a tutorial in markdown and putting it in the tutorials folder. 

use the ```##.tutorial name.md``` naming convention.  Example:  ```01.Getting Started With The Talon Alphabet.md```


The number will determine where it shows up on the list and the name will be turned into a voice command to open the tutorial. 

The tutorial works best if you write the markdown file one sentence per line.  

The tutorial reader reads the things line-by-line, and I haven't tried very long lines on it yet since the whole point is for this to have very short digestiable lines.
